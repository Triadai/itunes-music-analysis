    "# Machine Learning for music playlists\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating music playlists in iTunes with Scikit-Learn tools\n",
    "— March 2016 —\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Analysis overview\n",
    "This is a series of posts devoted to analysis of iTunes music library using **[Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org)** tools and the **[Echo Nest API](http://the.echonest.com/)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the analysis is to detect tracks in my iTunes music library that would suit my fitness practices, which are \"cycling\", \"yoga\", and \"ballet\". The reason I chose these categories is that I wanted to have two very different classes of songs (\"yoga\" and \"cycling\") and one more alike class — \"ballet\" — that might float between the other two classes. I'd like to find out what attributes make that difference.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve that problem I use Scikit-Learn machine learning classification algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Goals\n",
    "2.1. Build music playlists from my iTunes music library for my fitness practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2. Explore the basics of Scikit-Learn tools, including:\n",
    "* Classification algorithms;\n",
    "* One-Class SVM for novelty detection;\n",
    "* Model validation;\n",
    "* Data Standardization;\n",
    "* Dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3. Explore the Echo Nest API and track attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.4. Document the learning process step-by-step for myself and for other newbies at data analysis. Please take into consideration that I'm a greenhorn not only at data analysis but also at Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Contents\n",
